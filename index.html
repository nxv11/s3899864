  <h3>My Interest In IT</h3>
  <p>My interest in IT is in the networking field although I enjoy other areas of IT such as programming. </p>
  <p>My interest in IT started when I entered secondary, my love for computers came with gaming and </p>
  <p>learning about the parts needed to power a computer including the advanced programming and </p>
  <p>rendering needed to get games running. I have helped many inexperienced friends with their </p>
  <p>computer issues and have had a vast array of success with these challenges. </p>
