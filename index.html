  <h1 style="color:#7bb3a4;">About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Naveed, I am currently studying first year in the Bachelor Of Information</p>
  <p>Technology. My nationality is Sri Lankan and so is my culture, although I was born and raised in </p>
  <p>Australia. I am fluent in English and can understand some of my cultures language, Tamil. I recently </p>
  <p>got into a new hobby called ‘astrophotography’ and I enjoy spending my nights outside star gazing. I</p>
  <p>also enjoy gaming especially with friends whether its competitive or just for fun. I am</p>
  <p>approachable and would be open to communication if you are nice and polite.</p>
  <h3>My Interest In IT</h3>
  <p>My interest in IT is in the networking field although I enjoy other areas of IT such as programming. </p>
  <p>My interest in IT started when I entered secondary, my love for computers came with gaming and </p>
  <p>learning about the parts needed to power a computer including the advanced programming and </p>
  <p>rendering needed to get games running. I have helped many inexperienced friends with their </p>
  <p>computer issues and have had a vast array of success with these challenges. </p>
  <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
  <p>My ideal job would be in the areas of networking, cyber security, or cloud computing. An example </p>
  <p>for my ideal job can include the following job advertisement:</p>
    <img src="pics/job ad.png" alt="job advertisement">
  <h3>Job title: Cloud Operations Engineer</h3>
  <h5>About this job:</h5>
  <p>Support and project work in cloud software. Deployment and scripting of cloud applications </p>
  <p>for the business to use. BAU support work as well as complicated migration work. This position </p>
  <p>attracts me as it has very high pay and is involved with the future of cloud technologies. It appeals to </p>
  <p>me because it is related to cloud applications and the development of them to be implemented in businesses</p>

<div id="skills" class="tabcontent">
  <h1 style="color:#7bb3a4;">My ideal job<h1>
<h3>The skills required for my ideal job:</h3>
  <p>Prior experience in a Cloud Operations engineering role as a technical specialist.</p>
  <p>Strong skills in Linux, Networking, Scripting and Web Application Servers.</p>
  <p>Solid experience in supporting relational databases.</p>
  <p>Experience in customer driven environments.</p>
  <p>Experience in supporting SaaS based platforms.</p>
  <p>Experience in migrating customers to the cloud (AWS only).</p>
  <h3>The skills I currently have:</h3>

  <p>Basic programming skills</p>
  <p>Fast learner</p>
  <h3>My plan to acheive the skills necessary for my ideal job:</h3>
  <p>My plan to achieve the skills I need for my ideal job would be to gain experience in the IT field as I </p>
  <p>study. I would apply for contract jobs and work for little time at many different places which would </p>
  <p>allow me to slowly build up my resume and experience list. Then by the time I have finished my </p>
  <p>course, which is the Bachelor of Information Technology, I would have had a lot of reasonable </p>
  <p>experience in the IT field and would make it easy for me to find a job. Then I would slowly find better </p>
  <p>jobs and increase my ranking all the way up to my ideal job which would be any of the fields </p>
  <p>including networking, cloud computing or cyber security. I would also have multiple investments in </p>
  <p>crypto-currency and stocks to earn money on the side, which can help support my future family and </p>
  <p>allow me to have a source of income in the long term. </p>

  <h1 style="color:#7bb3a4;">Personal Profile</h1>
  <h4>What do the test results mean for me?</h4>
  <p>To me the Myers-Briggs test results are a vague indication to my true personality and that my </p>
  <p>personality is different in many ways such as the fact that I am truly not heartless, and I do care for </p>
  <p>people other than the ones closer to me. The learning styles test however shows that I am a visual </p>
  <p>learner which maybe correct as I learn better through tutorials which demonstrate a procedure. </p>
  <p>Although I can also learn well through figuring things out myself by simply experimenting. The big </p>
  <p>five personality test maybe correct in a way as I am less of an extrovert, but I do have high logical </p>
  <p>thinking and would rather use my logic to perform actions that simply going by my ‘heart’. Overall, </p>
  <p>these tests do not represent a true identification of myself, but they can give a very vague and short </p>
  <p>view of who I am.</p>
  <h4>How may these results influence my behaviour in a team?</h4>
  <p>These results will not change how I behave but they do indicate how I behave. When in a team I </p>
  <p>would contribute when I need to and would contribute so that the team succeeds, however I would </p>
  <p>not vote myself for a leading position as this is not one of my attributes or skills. Being in a team </p>
  <p>according to the test results would result in me contributing but not taking up leader roles and this </p>
  <p>gives an accurate representation to how I would behave truly.</p>
  <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
  <p>I would take this into account and form a team which already has a team leader and would help </p>
  <p>assist that team in its contributions but depend on another team member to coordinate the team. </p>
  <p>Although I would be open to contributions and feedback on my contributions and would like to </p>
  <p>improve to be a better teammate and help the team in succeeding.</p>
