  <h1 style="color:#7bb3a4;">About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Naveed, I am currently studying first year in the Bachelor Of Information</p>
  <p>Technology. My nationality is Sri Lankan and so is my culture, although I was born and raised in </p>
  <p>Australia. I am fluent in English and can understand some of my cultures language, Tamil. I recently </p>
  <p>got into a new hobby called ‘astrophotography’ and I enjoy spending my nights outside star gazing. I</p>
  <p>also enjoy gaming especially with friends whether its competitive or just for fun. I am</p>
  <p>approachable and would be open to communication if you are nice and polite.</p>
  <h3>My Interest In IT</h3>
  <p>My interest in IT is in the networking field although I enjoy other areas of IT such as programming. </p>
  <p>My interest in IT started when I entered secondary, my love for computers came with gaming and </p>
  <p>learning about the parts needed to power a computer including the advanced programming and </p>
  <p>rendering needed to get games running. I have helped many inexperienced friends with their </p>
  <p>computer issues and have had a vast array of success with these challenges. </p>
  <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
  <p>My ideal job would be in the areas of networking, cyber security, or cloud computing. An example </p>
  <p>for my ideal job can include the following job advertisement:</p>
    <img src="pics/job ad.png" alt="job advertisement">
  <h3>Job title: Cloud Operations Engineer</h3>
  <h5>About this job:</h5>
  <p>Support and project work in cloud software. Deployment and scripting of cloud applications </p>
  <p>for the business to use. BAU support work as well as complicated migration work. This position </p>
  <p>attracts me as it has very high pay and is involved with the future of cloud technologies. It appeals to </p>
  <p>me because it is related to cloud applications and the development of them to be implemented in businesses</p>

  <h3>My plan to acheive the skills necessary for my ideal job:</h3>
  <p>My plan to achieve the skills I need for my ideal job would be to gain experience in the IT field as I </p>
  <p>study. I would apply for contract jobs and work for little time at many different places which would </p>
  <p>allow me to slowly build up my resume and experience list. Then by the time I have finished my </p>
  <p>course, which is the Bachelor of Information Technology, I would have had a lot of reasonable </p>
  <p>experience in the IT field and would make it easy for me to find a job. Then I would slowly find better </p>
  <p>jobs and increase my ranking all the way up to my ideal job which would be any of the fields </p>
  <p>including networking, cloud computing or cyber security. I would also have multiple investments in </p>
  <p>crypto-currency and stocks to earn money on the side, which can help support my future family and </p>
  <p>allow me to have a source of income in the long term. </p>

  <img src="pics/myerbriggs.png" alt="Myer Briggs Test" style= "width:400px;height:500px;">
  <img src="pics/learning style.png" alt="Learning Styles" style= "width:600px;height:400px;">
  <img src="pics/big 5 test.png" alt="Big 5 personality test" style= "width:400px;height:200px;">
  <h4>What do the test results mean for me?</h4>
  <p>To me the Myers-Briggs test results are a vague indication to my true personality and that my </p>
  <p>personality is different in many ways such as the fact that I am truly not heartless, and I do care for </p>
  <p>people other than the ones closer to me. The learning styles test however shows that I am a visual </p>
  <p>learner which maybe correct as I learn better through tutorials which demonstrate a procedure. </p>
  <p>Although I can also learn well through figuring things out myself by simply experimenting. The big </p>
  <p>five personality test maybe correct in a way as I am less of an extrovert, but I do have high logical </p>
  <p>thinking and would rather use my logic to perform actions that simply going by my ‘heart’. Overall, </p>
  <p>these tests do not represent a true identification of myself, but they can give a very vague and short </p>
  <p>view of who I am.</p>
  <img src="pics/magman.png" alt="Magnifier man" style= "width:500px;height:200px;">
  <h4>How may these results influence my behaviour in a team?</h4>
  <p>These results will not change how I behave but they do indicate how I behave. When in a team I </p>
  <p>would contribute when I need to and would contribute so that the team succeeds, however I would </p>
  <p>not vote myself for a leading position as this is not one of my attributes or skills. Being in a team </p>
  <p>according to the test results would result in me contributing but not taking up leader roles and this </p>
  <p>gives an accurate representation to how I would behave truly.</p>
  <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
  <p>I would take this into account and form a team which already has a team leader and would help </p>
  <p>assist that team in its contributions but depend on another team member to coordinate the team. </p>
  <p>Although I would be open to contributions and feedback on my contributions and would like to </p>
  <p>improve to be a better teammate and help the team in succeeding.</p>

<h1 style="color:#7bb3a4;">Project idea</h1>
<img src="pics/lightbulb.png" alt="Lightbulb" style= "width:100px;height:100px;">
  <p>My project idea is to create an app that can take and convert pictures into PDF files and sort them </p>
  <p>according to their subject. This would be useful to use when needing to keep records of receipts or </p>
  <p>invoices. This app is important and useful for everyday people and would help make people’s lives </p>
  <p>easier and provide efficient recording of their data. During the development of this app, I would </p>
  <p>encounter some issues such as the conversion of different types of image files into a PDF for </p>
  <p>example some users may be using RAW image files and this is unusual but not impossible so I would </p>
  <p>have to find a way to convert that RAW image to a PDF file. </p>
  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p>The app would be a simple design and have easily accessible buttons and functions. It would take or </p>
  <p>obtain pictures using the gallery of already taken pictures or using the inbuilt camera to take a new </p>
  <p>picture. After this process it would convert the image into a PDF file format and store this file in a </p>
  <p>location of the user’s choice. The user can also set a folder to organise the PDF files automatically </p>
  <p>according to their type chosen by the user, an example of a type of can be ‘electronics’ or ‘groceries’. </p>
  <p>The app would also be able to set reminders for warranties for each separate PDF created and the </p>
  <p>app would be able to open the PDF files as well. </p>
  <h4>Motivation</h4>
  <p>An app that can organise receipts by converting them into readable file formats and sorting them </p>
  <p>according to their category/contents would be very convenient to the average consumer. According </p>
  <p>to goodfirms.co, productivity ranks first among most used app store categories. Which shows that </p>
  <p>people now days are into making their lives simple and easy by using apps for their daily tasks. My </p>
  <p>project idea would add to that category and help make people’s lives easier in the sense of </p>
  <p>organising and storing important data about their purchases. Creating an app would be convenient </p>
  <p>for people as opposed to creating a product as the app is available in just a few clicks from their </p>
  <p>personal smart device.</p>
  <h4>Description</h4>
  <p>The app would take the input data of a picture file which can be taken via the app or through the in-built</p>
  <p>gallery app on the smart phone device. The app would then ask permission of the user to allow </p>
  <p>access to storage, if the user accepted the app would proceed to process the image. The app then </p>
  <p>confirms whether the user would like to convert the picture file into a PDF. If the user accepts then </p>
  <p>the picture file would be converted into a PDF file format through a conversion process. After the </p>
  <p>conversion, the PDF is stored in a new folder created in the users’ storage. The app then allows the </p>
  <p>user to view the PDF and manage it. The app can allow the user to organise the PDF files and the </p>
  <p>user can set parameters in which the app will automatically recognise and organise the PDF files into </p>
  <p>their allocated folders. The app would include multiple customisations such as app themes and </p>
  <p>settings. It would also allow the user to delete, copy, cut or move PDF files from folder to folder like </p>
  <p>a regular file manager app. This app would also include the ability to back-up or restore the app data </p>
  <p>through a generated backup file which can be read by the app. The app can also encrypt the backup </p>
  <p>file where the user is given a key upon generation of the backup to allow the app to decrypt the </p>
  <p>backup file for use on the app upon restoration. Another security feature that the app would include </p>
  <p>is biometric app locking, depending on the smartphone, the app can be locked either by biometrics, </p>
  <p>a simple passcode or not have a lock at all. This would allow the users to store their important data </p>
  <p>without it being compromised by malicious apps or files and be protected from deliberate threats. </p>
  <p>Overall, this app would function to help the daily tasks that people encounter and would make their </p>
  <p>lives much more efficient and effective.</p>
  <h4>Tools and technologies:</h4>
  <p>The requirements needed to create this app would include a programming language which can be </p>
  <p>used to create mobile apps. This can be java, C++, C#, PHP, or python which can all program mobile </p>
  <p>applications. The programming language would be used to create the app which would run on </p>
  <p>android and apple devices. This would mean creating 2 different apps one that is built for the apple </p>
  <p>OS and one for the android OS. Adobe Photoshop can be used for the app design and layout which </p>
  <p>can influence the usability and ease of use of the application. Android studio is an open-source tool </p>
  <p>that can be used to emulate the app and test out its features while providing support to the many </p>
  <p>versions and models of devices.</p>
  <h4>Skills required:</h4>
  <p>The main skills needed are programming skills and specifically programming for mobile applications. </p>
  <p>Other skills include app design where the app must be made to conveniently allow users to navigate </p>
  <p>and use the app. Further skills required are communication skills to allow the collection of user </p>
  <p>feedback and implement changes to satisfy the user and their needs. Another skill required would </p>
  <p>include having some hardware knowledge which can help as knowing what each piece of hardware </p>
  <p>does can assist in programming software to utilize them. These skills are feasible and would be fairly </p>
  <p>easy to obtain, making the app a realistic innovation.</p>
  <h4>Outcome:</h4>
  <p>If the project is successful it would provide users with an app that increases their daily efficiency and </p>
  <p>effectiveness in tasks. It would allow users to store and manage receipts semi-automatically. The </p>
  <p>problem of having to take time to organise and scan the receipts a person obtains throughout their </p>
  <p>week has been solved with this app as the process can be done faster and easier. This development </p>
  <p>would fill in the gap in the market with an app that solves a problem that is faced by people almost </p>
  <p>daily.</p>
