  <h3>About me:</h3>
  <p>My name is Naveed, I am currently studying first year in the Bachelor Of Information</p>
  <p>Technology. My nationality is Sri Lankan and so is my culture, although I was born and raised in </p>
  <p>Australia. I am fluent in English and can understand some of my cultures language, Tamil. I recently </p>
  <p>got into a new hobby called ‘astrophotography’ and I enjoy spending my nights outside star gazing. I</p>
  <p>also enjoy gaming especially with friends whether its competitive or just for fun. I am</p>
  <p>approachable and would be open to communication if you are nice and polite.</p>
  <h3>My Interest In IT</h3>
  <p>My interest in IT is in the networking field although I enjoy other areas of IT such as programming. </p>
  <p>My interest in IT started when I entered secondary, my love for computers came with gaming and </p>
  <p>learning about the parts needed to power a computer including the advanced programming and </p>
  <p>rendering needed to get games running. I have helped many inexperienced friends with their </p>
  <p>computer issues and have had a vast array of success with these challenges. </p>
  <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
  <p>My ideal job would be in the areas of networking, cyber security, or cloud computing. An example </p>
  <p>for my ideal job can include the following job advertisement:</p>
  <h3>Job title: Cloud Operations Engineer</h3>
  <h5>About this job:</h5>
  <p>Support and project work in cloud software. Deployment and scripting of cloud applications </p>
  <p>for the business to use. BAU support work as well as complicated migration work. This position </p>
  <p>attracts me as it has very high pay and is involved with the future of cloud technologies. It appeals to </p>
  <p>me because it is related to cloud applications and the development of them to be implemented in businesses</p>

  <p>Strong skills in Linux, Networking, Scripting and Web Application Servers.</p>
  <p>Solid experience in supporting relational databases.</p>

  <h3>My plan to acheive the skills necessary for my ideal job:</h3>
  <p>My plan to achieve the skills I need for my ideal job would be to gain experience in the IT field as I </p>
  <p>study. I would apply for contract jobs and work for little time at many different places which would </p>
  <p>allow me to slowly build up my resume and experience list. Then by the time I have finished my </p>
  <p>course, which is the Bachelor of Information Technology, I would have had a lot of reasonable </p>
  <p>experience in the IT field and would make it easy for me to find a job. Then I would slowly find better </p>
  <p>jobs and increase my ranking all the way up to my ideal job which would be any of the fields </p>
  <p>including networking, cloud computing or cyber security. I would also have multiple investments in </p>
  <p>crypto-currency and stocks to earn money on the side, which can help support my future family and </p>
  <p>allow me to have a source of income in the long term. </p>
